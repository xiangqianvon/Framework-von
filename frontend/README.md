# Essentials to use this frontend

## Project setup

```
yarn
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build
```

Then `dist` folder should appear in `./frontend`. Go back to root dir of this project, then

```
python app.py
```

Here you go!


## Development of the frontend

Compiles and hot-reloads for development,

```
